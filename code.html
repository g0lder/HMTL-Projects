    <h1>Hello there 👋</h1>
    <p>There’s nothing special here.</p>

    <div id="secret">There is no secret code, nothing like <strong>Obgsx sc KWKJSXQ!</strong></div>

    <div id="sign">
      <p>There are so many better things you could be doing right now.</p>
      <p>Truly. Anything. A nap. A snack. Staring at a wall and contemplating mortality. And yet, despite all the warnings your instincts might have whispered — you’ve chosen to stop and read a sign that, by its very nature, promises absolutely nothing.</p>
      <p>It’s not glowing. It’s not locked. It’s not hidden in a corner behind three puzzles and a moral sacrifice. It’s just... here. Plain. Present. Irresistibly boring.</p>
      <p>And still, you read on.</p>
      <p>Why? Maybe you're hoping there's a reward. A secret. A twist. A password to unlock the next part of the game, or life, or... something. Maybe you're just chasing the vague idea that the act of continuing will eventually justify itself.</p>
      <p>Maybe you just like finishing things.</p>
      <p>And that’s where we are, now — past the halfway mark, too deep to justify stopping, but still not entirely sure why you’re here in the first place.</p>
      <p>You’ve been teased before, of course. Signs like this always do that — dangle just enough mystery to keep you invested. The suggestion of significance. The implication that those who read all the way to the end will be rewarded with something profound. Something hidden. Something worth it.</p>
      <p>But let’s be honest — even now, you’re not here because you think this sign will change your life. You’re here because you have to know how it ends.</p>
      <p>So let’s not drag it out.</p>
      <p><strong>And here you are, at the end, waiting for the final piece.</strong></p>
      <p>Something that may flip your life on its head and change everything…</p>
      <p>…and yet, you only find this.</p>
      <p><em>No twist. No clue.</em></p>
      <p><em>Definitely no reason to, say, click the bottom-right corner three times or hold the “Shift” key while putting the cursor on the sign for ten seconds. That would be ridiculous.</em></p>
      <p>After all, there’s nothing hidden here.<br>
      I mean, unless you missed something.</p>
